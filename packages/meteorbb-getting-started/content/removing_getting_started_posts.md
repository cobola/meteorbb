Removing Getting Started Posts

If you're ready to insert your own content and want to delete these getting started posts, comments, and users, you can do so with a single command.

Just make sure you're logged in, then open your browser console and type:

Meteor.call('removeGettingStartedContent');
See you on the other side!


### 清除所有帖子

如果你已经安装好了Telescope，就可以删掉这些初始化的帖子了，只用一个命令就可以了。


首先登陆，然后打开浏览器的 [browser console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) 敲入:

```js
Meteor.call('removeGettingStartedContent');
```
